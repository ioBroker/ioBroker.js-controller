**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.** For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)! Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## Description
This adapter allows to control Meross devices by connecting to the Meross cloud servers.

You need to provide your Cloud login credentials. The adapter connects to your cloud account and subscribe to all device data via MQTT. Because of this the devices need to be connected to their cloud. Currently no way is known to control the devices locally.

One Adapter instance will show all devices from one Meross Cloud account and allows to control them.

## Known working devices
* mss425e
* mss310
* MSS620 EU/UK


If more devices work (or also not) please report them by opening a GitHub issue.

## How to report issues and feature requests

Please use GitHub issues for this.

Best is to set the adapter to Debug log mode (Instances -> Expert mode -> Column Log level). Then please get the logfile from disk (subdirectory "log" in ioBroker installation directory and not from Admin because Admin cuts the lines). If you do not like providing it in GitHub issue you can also send it to me via email (iobroker@fischer-ka.de). Please add a reference to the relevant GitHub issue AND also describe what I see in the log at which time.
