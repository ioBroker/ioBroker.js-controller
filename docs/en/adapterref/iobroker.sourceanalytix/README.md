## Warning, this adapter needs node 8 or higher !!!

ioBroker SourceAnalytix allows you to keep track & trace of consumption, cost and meter values for your devices.
You need data as input (total amount of Wh, l/h or m3 used) from your devices and this adapter will :

* Trace comsumption daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
* calculate costs (current price is configurable)
* Can be used for Power Consumption, liquids, and GAS
* Input values can be wh/kWh/m3/l

## How-To

* [ ] To-Do

This adapter has is roots with thanks to pix back in 2016 
https://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2262

Which has been improved by @hadering and published on github
https://github.com/hdering/homematic_verbrauchszaehler

## Known issues

* [ ] Period calculation selectable but not yet implemented
* [ ] quarters not calculated
* [ ] monthly costprice not yet implemented in calculation
* [x] store current meter values not yet implemented
* [x] Meter value selectable  but not yet implemented
* [x] adapter restart needed to add calculation of new objects
* [x] statest for cost type delivery are not writen
* [x] device name alias not correct
* [x] translations

## To-Do
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] Cost default value to 0 with error message if not provided
* [ ] recalcalation based on meter values (configurable by date)
* [ ] calculations for quarter values
* [ ] add object states for previous [x]day, [x]week, [x]month, [x]quarter, [x]year configurable in adapter settings
* [ ] code optimalisation
* [x] storage of meter values for every state
* [x] compact mode
* [x] add support for calculation of wh values
* [x] Fix basic translations
* [x] ready state values and store to states
* [x] write meter value to "start" state to use in calculations
* [x] configurable intervall for every state
* [x] configurable unit for every state
* [x] configurable cost price for every state
* [x] configurable unit price for every state
* [x] state used for cost or earning
* [x] consumption calculation
* [x] cost calculation
* [x] adjustable starting point of meassurement
* [x] support of multiple device states
* [x] write meter value to object to use in calculations
* [x] configuration in adapter settings (currently only demo objects of discovergy are supported)
* [x] delete temporary states for calculations
* [x] calculation for m3 values
* [x] use alias of device name
* [x] configurable data points (yes/no) for cost, consumption and meter-values
* [x] Make it selectable to store analytics for complete year or only selectable periode
* [x] ensure all values are stored when adapter shuts down to prevent data gaps
