Detailed analysis of your Energy, gas and liquid consumptions
Any source (kWh, Wh, Watt, l/h or m3 )can be used for data analyses :

* Trace comsumption daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
* calculate costs (current price is configurable)
* Can be used for Power Consumption, liquids, and GAS
* Input values can be wh/kWh/Watt/m3/l

## How-To

Please provide your feedback here https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/31932/major-update-sourceanalytix-0-4-0-complete-code-rebuild

This adapter has is roots with thanks to pix back in 2016 
https://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2262

Which has been improved by @hadering and published on github
https://github.com/hdering/homematic_verbrauchszaehler

## Known issues

* [ ] Period calculation selectable but not yet implemented
* [ ] monthly costprice not yet implemented in calculation

## To-Do
* [ ] Documentation
* [ ] recalcalation based on meter values (configurable by date)
* [ ] add object states for previous [x]day, [x]week, [x]month, [x]quarter, [x]year configurable in adapter settings
