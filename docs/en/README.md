# Welcome to ioBroker
!> **Note for beginners**

> If too many unknown terms have been used when reading these first words, they will be explained again in detail on [next page](basics/README.md).

ioBroker is a software solution for integrating various smarthome systems that would remain without ioBroker island solutions in an overall system.

ioBroker is therefore the *** integration platform for the Internet of Things.

An ioBroker system has a modular structure. A variety of ***adapters*** allows communication with over 200 different platforms from A like Alexa to Z like time tracking.

Be it the integration of commercial products from almost all areas of life or the integration of a self-created solution - ioBroker makes almost everything possible.

We are grateful for any help in creating new articles or for improvements. Information on this can be found in [in the forum](https://forum.iobroker.net). <br><br> **Until all contents have been taken over, the old documentation is still [to find here](http://www.iobroker.net). It will be successively replaced by the new documentation.**

## Cross-platform
Anyone familiar with home automation will sooner or later discover that systems are often not perfect. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses. ioBroker is therefore cross-platform. Parallel operation with existing solutions is possible at any time. Synergy effects can be used and the best of all worlds brought together.

ioBroker itself is at home on almost all platforms. ioBoker can be installed under Windows, Linux, OSX or as Dockerimage.
Preconfigured installation images remove the installation work from the user.

An optional cloud-based access allows the user or system integrators to remotely manage to a locally installed ioBroker 24/7 system. The access control can be freely configured by users and groups by the user.

## Scalable
If additional Smarthome systems are to be connected over time, they can be implemented by the user at any time via additional adapters during operation. ioBroker itself is also scalable.
Several ioBroker servers can be connected to a `Mutihost` system.
It's even possible to mix operating system platforms and couple SoC single-board computers with large multicore servers.
For systems with the highest performance requirements, optional Redis, a particularly fast database, can be integrated.

## Programmable
An optional programming is done with JavaScript, a script language that has been steadily developed since 1995. This is easy to learn, so that new requirements can be quickly implemented. This makes it possible for everyone to contribute to ioBroker and also to implement individual requirements.

For beginners in the programming the variant 'Blockly' is available, which makes it possible without extensive programming knowledge itself by 'drag and drop' to get results quickly.

## Visualization
With `VIS` ioBroker provides a powerful tool for creating an individual visualization. Current values of sensors can be displayed graphically as well as historical gradients. Live images of surveillance cameras, the implementation of an alarm system, heating systems and air conditioning - almost everything that can be imagined, can also be implemented.

The user has maximum freedom of design. Prefabricated building blocks for easy use help the user. But not only the display of information is possible. The control of devices is also quickly implemented via the visualization interface. The operation of the interface can be adapted to a wide variety of devices - from the smartphone via the wall tablet with touch function to the personal computer - everything can be realized by simple drag and drop.

Simple prefabricated user interfaces can be quickly realized with the material adapter or HabPanel adapter.

## Community
Since 2014, ioBroker has been widely supported by thousands of users and developers due to its many benefits. Users and developers meet in the specially created [Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net) and exchange their experiences and suggestions. Since ioBroker is open source software, all source texts are freely available on the platform [GitHub](https://github.com/ioBroker).

?> What ioBroker is not: ioBroker is not commercial software. ioBroker is developed and maintained by volunteers. Therefore, the use of the software on their own liability, except the intent of willful harm.
There is no contracted support.
