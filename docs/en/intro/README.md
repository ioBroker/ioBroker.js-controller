** This documentation is the central reference for all ioBroker users: **

## Page structure
This page was created in a ***responsive design*** . This means that it is displayed differently for optimal readability depending on the resolution of the display of the reader (PC / tablet / mobile phone).

With low (effective) resolutions, operating elements are partially hidden in order to make space for the main window.

It is therefore possible that the current display differs from the screenshots.

### Different menus
To get the best possible overview, there are a total of three different menus:

![Side menus](../../de/intro/media/Seite_numbers.png)

---

#### 1.) Main menu
The main points of this menu are usually visible on the PC in the title bar of the page; the entire menu is hidden at low resolutions.
Then it has to be opened by clicking the burger icon:

![Pages menu](../../de/intro/media/Hauptmenu.png)

After clicking on a menu item, the menu closes automatically to make more space for the content.

---

#### 2.) Documentation menu This menu is usually visible on the PC, but is hidden at low resolutions. Then it has to be opened by clicking the burger icon:
![Documentation menu](../../de/intro/media/Dokumenu.png)

There is a filter field in the top line. By entering a term, the entire menu tree is filtered for this term and only suitable menu items are displayed.

The menu can be hidden again using the icon with the arrow to make more space for the content.

---

#### 3.) Topic menu
In this menu the main topics of the selected article are displayed in order to be able to navigate more quickly to a desired point.

![Themed menu](../../de/intro/media/Themenmenu.png)

The menu can be hidden again using the icon with the **X**

### More controls
#### 4.) Language selection
The website is multilingual. More languages will be added gradually. Some are generated automatically first, native speakers are invited to improve the texts.

The desired language can be selected at the globe icon.

![language selection](../../de/intro/media/Languages.png)

This language list will be expanded if necessary.

#### 5.) Search
This field does not need any explanation. Please use extensively!
