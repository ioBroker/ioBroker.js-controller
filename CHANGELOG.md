	## __WORK IN PROGRESS__
-->

## 3.2.12 (2021-01-28)
* (foxriver76) fix repo cli
* (foxriver76) add instances list back to 'status all'
* (Apollon77) optimize logging in db classes
* (Apollon77) enhance letsencrypt to also allow to specify alternative names for certs
* (Apollon77) deleting a not existing object is handled as success instead of Not-Exists error

## 3.2.11 (2021-01-24) Release Grace
**BREAKING CHANGES**
* None, Supported are nodejs 10.x, 12.x and 14.x (Node.js 15.x is also working WHEN USED WITH npm 6!! in the automated tests, but formally not supported)
* If you have enabled Multihost Discovery please disable and enable it again if you really need it persistent running. By re-enabling it you update the used passphrase with a better encryption mechanism.
* (Foxriver76) Harmonize username handling between admin and js-controller by transforming the object id to lowercase. With this user names will be treated case insensitive from now on!

**Features**
* (raintonr) Update Let's encrypt implementation; all relevent adapters (web and such) need updates to use it! NEEDS NODE.JS 12.x+! (see DOCS LINK TODO)
* (bluefox) Restart adapters that use Let's encrypt after certificates were updated
* (bluefox) Provide min/max for convert alias functions
* (foxriver76) handling major adapter upgrades more carefully (CLI on upgrade will show if it's a major upgrade  and major upgrades will be skipped on upgrade all when executed by admin

* (bluefox) Added "http" and "stream" options for logs
* (Apollon77) add seq logging support to js-controller

**Optimizations and Fixes**
* (foxriver76) Detect adapter restart loops and stop restarting after 3 crashes (an adapter is considered "working" when no crash by an exception happens within 10 minutes)
* (foxriver76) Fix failed logins if username is uppercase, be reworking user logic and caching
* (bluefox) Set for def states the quality: QUALITY_SUBS_INITIAL
* (AlCalzone) fix npm uninstall loglevel argument

* (AlCalzone) Package-Manager: log which packages were (already) installed
* (foxriver76) replace redis "KEYS" command by "SCAN" to optimize redis access performance
* (foxriver76) optimize redis library usage to prevent errors on redis outages
* (bluefox) Catch errors when plugins initialize. At least log will work and could be checked for errors.
* (foxriver76) allow migration of instances to already existing host 
* (foxriver76) also allow <adapter>.<instance-nr> for install/add cli command
* (AlCalzone) buffer streams that are piped to stdout to fix weird Windows logging cases
* (foxriver76/AlCalzone) Optimize upgrade/downgrade logic for adapters, ask for a downgrade only if lower version is to be installed
* (foxriver76) allow redis redis migration when changing host of redis - fix bug where process crashes when controller is running when migrating
* (bluefox) Catch errors for subscribe on alias without target
* (foxriver76) only perform auto scaling on alias if not null
* (foxriver76) if repository request fails also use cached sources on updating repository
* (foxriver76) prevent host deletion from same host - otherwise it will remove the system.host states but instances will still be on the removed host, because transfer happens to itself
* (foxriver76) use instanceObjects from system.adapter.* object instead from io-package.json
* (foxriver76) notify of errors on readFileCertificates to show permission problems etc.
* (foxriver76) multihost discovery now logs ignored messages on debug and also logs the senders address
* (foxriver76) sync up created objects on instance start and instance creation by using helper function in tools.js, e.g. .loglevel was missing on instance creation
* (bluefox) Package-Manager: Filter empty packets out to suppress error message
* (foxriver76) rename repository names for new installations and on updates to beta/stable
* (foxriver76) rewrite collectDiagInfo to Promises and fix minor issue with it

* (foxriver76) ensure setAdapterInstanceEnabled can not hang
* (Apollon77, foxriver, bluefox, AlCalzone) Several fixes and refactorings to prevent potential crash cases reported by Sentry and other sources

**Developer relevant DEPRECATIONS/WARNINGS**
* (foxriver76) we warn if object not exists when setting a state via adapter.set*State*. Adjust your code that a state value is NOT set before the object is successfully created. If this deep check is NOT wanted for performance reasons the adapter needs to be initialized with strictObjectChecks = false!!  (see DOCS LINK TODO)
* (foxriver76) readFile should not validate meta object, we now throw on writeFile if id is no valid meta object
* (AlCalzone) update Forbidden ID Characters: use Unicode properties to define which characters are allowed instead of blacklisting. For ASCII the allowed characters are the same as before - for other languages mainly character class of Unicode are allowed! (see DOCS LINK TODO)

* (foxriver76) remove getMessage shim, no adapter uses it anymore; was logged as deprecated before

* (bluefox) Add system view to filter for "folder" objects
* (bluefox) add set/clearTimeout and set/clearInterval to adapter methods and check on unload that they were all cleared and clear if needed with logging, so developers are reminded to clean up!
* (AlCalzone) Add ...Async version for getChannels - make sure to check before using or use correct js-controller version dependency!
* (Apollon77) modularize databases into own npm packages and basically support adding new types of databases; add deprecation infos and logging to "old legacy" files in lib/states and lib/objects to not be used anymore; requires mostly updates in testing (see DOCS LINK TODO)
* (foxriver76) allow to specify the instance for debug starts (`iobroker debug adaptername.1`)
