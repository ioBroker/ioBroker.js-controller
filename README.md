# ioBroker
*...domesticate the Internet of Things.*

ioBroker is an integration platform for the Internet of Things, focused on Smarthome, Building Automation, Ambient
Assisted Living, Process Automation, Visualization and Data Logging. It aims to be a possible replacement for software
like f.e. OpenHAB or The Thing System. ioBroker will be the successor of [CCU.IO](http://ccu.io), a project quite
popular in the german HomeMatic community.

## Concept
ioBroker is not just an application, it's more of a a concept, a database schema, and offers a very easy way for systems
to interoperate. ioBroker defines some common rules for a pair of databases used to exchange data and publish events
between different systems.

### Adapters
Systems are attached to ioBrokers databases via so called adapters, technically processes running anywhere
in the network and connecting all kinds of systems to ioBrokers databases. A connection to ioBrokers databases can be
easily implemented in nearly any programming language on nearly any platform that is capable of doing ip networking.


### Databases
ioBroker uses Redis and CouchDB. Redis is an in-memory key-value data store and also a message broker with
publish/subscribe pattern. It's used to maintain and publish all states of connected systems. CouchDB is used to store
rarely changing and larger data, like metadata of systems and things, configurations or any additional files.


### Security
ioBroker is designed to be accessed by trusted adapters inside trusted networks. This means that usually it is not a
good idea to expose the ioBroker databases directly to the internet or, in general, to an environment where untrusted
clients can directly access ioBroker databases network services. There are different special adapters that offer
services supposed to be exposed to the internet, for example webserver-adapters for user interfaces. These should be
handled with care, for example with additional security measures like VPN and VLAN usage or reverse proxys.
